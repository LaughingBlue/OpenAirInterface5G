This directory contains the NFAPI code.

It comes in two parts:

1 - open-nFAPI

    This is a clone of the github repository
    (https://github.com/cisco/open-nFAPI,
     commit b3bc579b1697eab829d5d8a2de59c93a61b88fa4).
    The patch open-nfapi.oai.patch has then been applied.

2 - oai_integration

    This is code written by David Price from Cisco to integrate
    open-nFAPI into OpenAirInterface.
