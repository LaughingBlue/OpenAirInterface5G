### logging facility developer usage
The logging facility objectives are
1. provide a common console tracing mechanism
1. Allow a flexible activation of console traces, by configuration or dynamically at any time while code is running.

Most developpers will only use the log macros to add console messages to the code. The logging facility also provides an api that is used for initialization and configuration.
